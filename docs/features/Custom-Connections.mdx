# Custom Connections
The <TypeLink type="CompanyOwnership" /> component includes a rendering feature that enables users to customize connection visualizations.
It grants control over parameters such as stroke, bend smoothing, thickness, and arrow styles.

The rendering process employs an SVG path element, allowing for the utilization of CSS to customize the stroke or
incorporate transitions by defining a <TypeLink type="ConnectionStyle" member="className"/>. Note that to optimize performance, and depending on the implementation,
it might be necessary to memoize the rendering function.

The parameter passed to the connection style provider is an object containing
the connection itself as well as the source and target company items.
