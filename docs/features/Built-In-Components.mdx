# Built-In Components

There are optional components available to enhance the interaction with company ownership diagram, which can be added as children of the <TypeLink type="CompanyOwnership" /> component:
<ul className="list-disc ml-4">
    <li>**<TypeLink type="Overview" />**: Presents a simplified view of the entire graph along with the current viewport.</li>
    <li>**<TypeLink type="Controls" />**: Features a toolbar with buttons to adjust the viewport.</li>
</ul>

The controls component comes with a default implementation for company ownership diagrams.
